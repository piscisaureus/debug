A not so serious pair of logos about CSS. Randomly created, but the final "thing" is definitely working in some ways. I think?

**Fun attributes:**
- playful use of boxes
- uses the system font (def looks different on my machine ðŸ˜‰)
- light / dark theme adaptive
- resize adaptive
- position in CSS 3D perspective
- no position absolute

**Regrts:**
- not loading a font?
- trying harder to use `skew()`
- no accessibility testing
- not using container queries somehow
- sticking to system colors

### Dramatic glowy

Neat-ish. Take away the glow and it still stands.

## Where did these come from?

I saw a brand do something similar with different letters, and I imagined CSS could do something really similar, but its way. **CSS is about making boxes**, a CSS logo could make a box. 

Then I wanted it to be adaptive to color, resize, moreâ€¦ and well its been fun, but I kinda wanna pass the torch. See what some forks can do? :wink wink: 

**STEAL THIS!** Use this wherever you want; no restrictions.

There's some neat opportunities for 3D rotating on the `transform` of `.cube`; accelerometer or mouse position much?

Does CSS need a new big 4 instead? ðŸ˜‰
