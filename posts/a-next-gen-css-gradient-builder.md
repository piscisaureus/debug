Still a lot to do but also already offering a lot to learn! So stoked to release this for public availability 🤘🏻💀

## cross browser

It's a little ahead of it's time, as Firefox doesn't fully support all the features yet, but it will and this tool is worth investing time into now.

## special features

Learning opportunities for:
- double position syntax
- transition hints
- wide gamut color picking
- hue interpolation methods
- linear angle keywords

Hope it helps you as much as it's already helped me!
