Roman Komarov forked a demo of mine the other day and showed how CSS [scroll driven animation](https://scroll-driven-animations.style) could map the `input[type=range]` slider's thumb pseudo element position and use it to power a percentage in a gradient mask. 

Roman explains it all very well [here on their blog](https://blog.kizu.dev/input-range-thumb/).

It's **super rad**. And totally triggered 2 ideasâ€¦

## FORK THE FORK!!!

The first idea I was able to finish tonight, and the 2nd I'll do sometime soon. *Ssssecretssss*

Here's my fork of their fork, repurposed their mapping to power the fill of a range slider. A task that's not so easy.

I left a good chunk of comments in there!

While this may not have great support at the moment, and is quite a little web of CSS to setupâ€¦ it's a very promising path forward for styling `input[type=range]` and **other components with moveable parts**. 

I'll be stashing this into my CSS tricks ðŸª¦
