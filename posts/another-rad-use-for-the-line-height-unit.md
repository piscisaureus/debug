CSS has a unit that represents the current `line-height` of it's context. How rad is that. I've been having fun finding use cases for thisâ€¦ `lh`.

## peep it

## the concept

Any `line-height` value above unitless `1` will get distributed to the line box as "half leading". Think of it like equal `block` spacing distribution. Well now we have `lh` for use in `calc()` and to perhaps distribute equal `inline` spacing.

That led me to this rad use case for a tiny tag component thingy.

```css
.tag {
  padding-inline: .25lh;
}
```

Which `.25lh` was because the element already had `line-height` set to `1.5`. 

Might as well turn it into a `calc()` because it matches the intent and makes the computer do the math, plus add the `line-height` to the demo so it's all there at a glance:

```css
.tag {
  line-height: 1.5;
  padding-inline: calc(.5lh / 2);
}
```

And here's the developer's cut:

```css
.tag {
  /* .5 extra leading */
  line-height: 1.5;
  
  /* we can divvy equal spacing to the inline edges */
  /* complimenting extra height half leading */
  /* making even spacing all around */
  padding-inline: calc(.5lh / 2);
}
```

## outro

This isn't *that* cool, but also like, **I thought it was** cool.
