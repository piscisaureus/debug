Was on the [Cloudinary DevJams](https://training.cloudinary.com/) Podcast!

🎙️ [Watch it (or listen)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsCv1lHS85w)

We chat about making the [nerdy.dev](https://nerdy.dev/) site with [Deno](https://deno.com/runtime) and [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/), and of course we chat all about how I'm serving images 🙂
