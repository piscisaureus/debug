[Deno](https://deno.land/) & [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/) have been rad.  
Same goes for [Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

**butâ€¦**

95% of the issues have been deps.

I have deps on [NPM](npmjs.com/), [deno.land](https://deno.land/), [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/), and [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/)â€¦  if any of these services hiccup, and I try and build; builds fail.

No single service can serve all the modules I need, and I don't need that many
