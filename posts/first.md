Regular Markdown syntax is not processed within code blocks. E.g.,
asterisks are just literal asterisks within a code block. This means
it's also easy to use Markdown to write about Markdown's own syntax.

```css
@layer demo {
  h1 {
    text-emphasis-style: "ðŸ”¥";
  }
}
```

```js
const foo = () => {
  return console.log(window)
}
```

*single asterisks*

_single underscores_

**double asterisks**

__double underscores__
