When a gradient needs to transition from one color to the next, it takes the [shortest](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hue-shorter) route it can. But what if the result of that stinks?

### Hue interpolation

That's where new CSS gradient syntax from [Color 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4) for [hue interpolation](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hue-interpolation) comes in. Here I specify the gradient takes the [longer](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hue-longer) route:

```css
.gradient-with-hue-interpolation-specified {
  background: linear-gradient(
    to right in hsl longer hue, 
    oklch(63% 0.3 317), 
    oklch(63% 0.2 255)
  );
}
```

It's almost like the browser has been Zoolander this whole time, it would only turn right ðŸ˜‚

Here's 2 demo's that use [ColorJS](https://colorjs.io/) to help illustrate the effects of this hue interpolation choice. Aka, demo's that help the browser turn left hehe.

### Blue to Purple example
