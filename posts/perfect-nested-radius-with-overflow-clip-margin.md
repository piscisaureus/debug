With a [mega viral tweet](https://twitter.com/lilykonings/status/1567317037126680576) on nesting border radii and [Andy mentioning it as well](https://twitter.com/piccalilli_/status/1630889802059874310), I felt I should blog about my thoughts real quick! Here's one of the things I learned after [requesting CSS get a nice way to draw nested radii](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7707):

```css
.the-trick-tldr {
  overflow: clip;
  overflow-clip-margin: content-box;
}
```

If you're like me, you saw that and saidâ€¦

## The prob

**Nested border curves.**

When you've got a rounded card with a rounded button inside, or a rounded footer inside a rounded section, you may not have noticed, but there's a wobble in there.

See the nested radii on the left here ðŸ™ˆ,  
vs the radii on the right âœ…:

Click those tweets or read [the CSSWG proposal](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7707) for more about the problem space and calculations for solutions.

## Using overflow-clip-margin to solve it

In the comments of the CSSWG issue, [Oriol Brufau](https://github.com/Loirooriol) politely [mentions](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7707#issuecomment-1239884828) using [`overflow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow) on the `content-box` with [`overflow-clip-margin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/overflow-clip-margin). And it works great, but [Caniuse](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_overflow-clip-margin) shows you how it's not really viable yet:

tldr;
- No Safari
- Firefox doesn't support the `content-box` value
- â€¦ Chrome only.

## Try yourself

Here's [a Codepen](https://codepen.io/argyleink/embed/preview/mdGMqOJ) where I show the problem space and offer a custom property and `overflow-clip-margin` solution, for testing and comparing.

It's totally worth opening in a tab in Chrome and inspecting that card for it's funky coo `content-box` `overflow: clip` solution, and kickin the tires ðŸ¤“
