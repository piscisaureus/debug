## Missing or Painful

Very validating to see CSS Nesting at the top of the [Missing Features](https://2022.stateofcss.com/en-US/usage/#missing_features_freeform) chart ðŸ¤“

Then again here for top [Pain Points](https://2022.stateofcss.com/en-US/usage/#other_pain_points_freeform)!

## Learn CSS Shoutout

[Una](https://una.im/) and I **worked hard** to create complimentary content for [our podcast](https://pod.link/thecsspodcast) and I'm super happy to see it has resonated with the community.

## Open Props Shoutout

I was super excited and surprised by [Open Props](https://open-props.style/) topping the charts for the "Other Tools" category. Folks had to hand write this as it wasn't just a checkbox that could be checked, making me even more surprised since it was high effort in comparison.

Thanks y'all for all this!
